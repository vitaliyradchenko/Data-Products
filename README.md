#Coursera Developing Data Products Course Project

This peer assessed course project has two parts.

First part: The Shiny Application

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using my application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the text box on the peer assessment site of COURSERA.
4. Share the server.R and ui.R code on github
Second part: Reproducible Pitch Presentation

I get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a my app. I am going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what I need

1. 5 slides to pitch my idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
2. My presentation pushed to github or Rpubs
3. A link to my github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the text box on the peer assessment site of COURSERA.
